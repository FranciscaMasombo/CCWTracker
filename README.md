# CCWTracker
This is my first ever web application it is a weight watchers tracker where users can track each other’s progress. It’s a full crud application, for the users to be able to app a submission of there current weight, they will need to be registered and login.

# App Features
The user needs to register and login first because if they try to add, review or update information. if they try to do any thing with out login in an error message will pop up. 
I used sessions for my authentication once the use is logged in they are logged in until they logout which will then destroy the session. 
When the user is registered the users, password is also encrypted using bcryptjs
